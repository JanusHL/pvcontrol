# pvcontrol
I've worked for years with Omron PLC's and I programmed a simple function to read a power meter for my FV system. In 2018 I moved to Raspberry pi to take more control of the system. In this repository I want to leave the utilities I use to do the job.

# Hardware
2 x Victron Multiplus 2000/24

2 x Midnite Classic 150

1 x Growatt 1000S Grid Inverter

BMV700

DDS238 energy meter
